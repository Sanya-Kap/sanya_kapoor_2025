Hello, my name is Sanya Kapoor and I am a junior.  

A few things about me:
- I'm in a family of four and have one older brother. üë™
- I like to crochet clothes and design all sorts of things! üëó
- I play the oboe in school and in a band outside of school üéµ
- I was born and raised in San Diego, and have lived in one house my whole life üè° but I love to travel üöÅ

Some places I have traveled:
- <p style="color:greenyellow;"> India </p>
    I go there the most often (Around every 2 years). My grandparents on both sides and my aunt lives there. Last time I visited was because of my eldest cousins wedding. I have visited 7 states there. I love the momos. I'd reccomend visiting the Taj Mahal because it is a classic. It has amazing gardens and beautiful architecture. Jaipur is also a great place to visit. there you can visit the Amber Fort, City Palace, Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds), and the Jantar Mantar Observatory. Explore colorful bazaars and indulge in traditional Rajasthani cuisine. Mumbai is also a great place to visit and is along the coast. You can visit the Gateway of India, explore Elephanta Caves, stroll along Marine Drive, and experience the vibrant nightlife. And don‚Äôt miss Bollywood tours and tasting local street food.

- <p style="color:red;"> Japan </p>
    I went here during the summer of 2023. It was a family trip before my brother left for college. We went to the worlds largest fish market with 30 dollar strawberries. We went on a good old hike to the top of a temple. My dad loves hiking. He's a fanatic. I reccomend visiting Hiroshima. It is a city with deep historical significance, known for peace memorials and its rebirth after WWII. Over there, you can visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, the Atomic Bomb Dome, and the Peace Memorial Museum. Take a ferry to nearby Miyajima Island to see the iconic Itsukushima Shrine with its ‚Äúfloating‚Äù torii gate. If I get to get again, I would visit Okinawa. It is a tropical island with beautiful beaches and a distinct culture. I could relax on the beaches, snorkel or dive in the coral reefs of the Kerama Islands, and learn about Okinawan history at Shurijo Castle. Okinawa also has a unique cuisine worth trying, like Okinawa soba and goya champuru.
- <p style="color:indianred;"> Canada </p>
    We have visited Canada a few times because my cousins live here. I really loved visiting banff national park which had a nice frozen lake. We were super close to seeing the northern lights, but missed it by a few days. i'd reccomend visiting Banff National Park. You can hike the scenic trails, take a boat ride on Lake Louise, and explore the crystal-clear waters of Moraine Lake. In winter, ski at Banff‚Äôs famous resorts like Sunshine Village and Lake Louise Ski Resort. Niagara Falls is also a classic. You can take a boat ride on the Hornblower to the base of the falls, walk along the scenic promenade, and visit the observation decks for breathtaking views. Don‚Äôt miss the nearby town of Niagara-on-the-Lake for wineries and charming streets. Jasper National Park is also great to hike through scenic valleys and mountains, visit the Athabasca Glacier and Sunwapta Falls, and to take a boat tour of Maligne Lake. Jasper is also part of a designated Dark Sky Preserve, making it a great place for stargazing.

- <p style="color:yellowgreen;"> Mexico </p>
    I have gone here a few times because it is close enough to make a road trip out of it. We recently went here with my extended family. We stayed at a nice resort with delicious buffets. I wish I could go back and devour the icecream one more time before I die. I also loved swimming with dolphins. Quite a fun story to tell others. I loved swimming through caves. However, there were a lot of bats and my dad can't swim, so it was very chaotic. I'd reccomend visiting Mexico City. Over there you can visit the historic center (Z√≥calo), the Metropolitan Cathedral, and the ancient Aztec ruins of Templo Mayor. Explore Chapultepec Park, the National Museum of Anthropology, and the Frida Kahlo Museum (Casa Azul). Stroll through the neighborhoods of Roma and Condesa for trendy restaurants and caf√©s. Personally, I loved Canc√∫n . You can relax on the white-sand beaches and swim in the turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea. Explore nearby cenotes (natural sinkholes) and visit the underwater museum (MUSA). Take day trips to Isla Mujeres or Cozumel for snorkeling or diving.

- <p style="color:crimson;"> England </p>   
    This was a family trip, because my mom really wanted to go. We went for around 4 days as a stopover before going to India. I'd reccomend visiting London for the Buckingham Palace, the British Museum, the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, and the London Eye. It also has some really nice colleges to see like Oxford and Cambridge. Additionally in Cornwall, you can visit St. Ives, Land's End, and Tintagel Castle (associated with the legend of King Arthur). You will also enjoy surfing, coastal walks, and exploring small fishing villages. Liverpool is also a classic. I'd reccomend to visit the Beatles Story Museum and take a Magical Mystery Tour to explore the places associated with the band. Explore the historic Albert Dock, visit the Tate Liverpool art gallery, and learn about the city‚Äôs rich maritime history at the Merseyside Maritime Museum. Birmingham is also well liked. Visit the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, explore the city‚Äôs famous canals, and enjoy the vibrant food scene, particularly in the Balti Triangle. Birmingham is also known for its shopping, especially at the Bullring Shopping Centre. Additionally, in Windsor you can tour Windsor Castle, explore the beautiful Windsor Great Park, and take a boat ride along the River Thames. The nearby town of Eton is home to the famous Eton College.

- <p style="color:Navy;"> Alaska </p>
    This was many years ago and was one of my first big trips. I have a lot of fun memories like gold mining and sight seeing. I reccomend visiting Denali National Park. It has wildlife viewing (moose, bears, caribou), hiking, camping, and scenic drives along Denali Park Road. Glacier Bay National Park is also a great place to visit. It has boat tours, kayaking, whale watching, and viewing massive glaciers calving into the water. Kodiak Island has fun outdoor activities: bear viewing tours, fishing, hiking, and exploring Fort Abercrombie State Historical Park. Anchorage is also great for a family visit. You can visit the Anchorage Museum for an insight into Alaska‚Äôs history and culture. Walk or bike along the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail, explore the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, and enjoy the local food scene. Anchorage is also a gateway to many outdoor activities, such as hiking, fishing, and skiing. I want to go to Wrangell-St. Elias National Park next time. I would explore the remote and rugged landscapes, hike to glaciers, and visit the historic Kennecott Mines. The park offers opportunities for mountaineering, backcountry hiking, and wildlife viewing.
