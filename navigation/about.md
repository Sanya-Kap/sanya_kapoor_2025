Hello, my name is Sanya Kapoor and I am a junior.  

A few things about me:
- I'm in a family of four and have one older brother. 👪
- I like to crochet clothes and design 👗
- I play the oboe 🎵
- I was born and raised in San Diego, and have lived in one house my whole life 🏡
- I love to travel 🚁

Some places I have traveled:
- <p style="color:greenyellow;"> India </p>
    I go here the most often (Around every 2 years). My grandparents on both sides and my aunt lives here. Last time I visited, was because of my eldest cousins wedding. 
<br>
- <p style="color:red;"> Japan </p>
    I went here during the summer of 2023. It was a family trip before my brother left for college. 
- <p style="color:indianred;"> Canada </p>
    We have visited Canada a few times because my cousins live here.
<br> 
- <p style="color:yellowgreen;"> Mexico </p>
    I have gone here a few times because it is close enough to make a road trip out of it. We recently went here with my extended family. 
<br>
- <p style="color:crimson;"> England </p>   
    This was a family trip, because my mom really wanted to go. We went for around 4 days as a stopover before going to India. 
<br>
- <p style="color:Navy;"> Alaska </p>
    This was many years ago and was one of my first big trips. I have a lot of fun memories like gold mining and sight seeing.
