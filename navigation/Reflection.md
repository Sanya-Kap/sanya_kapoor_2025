Big Ideas and Teaching: How I’m Prepared for Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) and Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
My table made the lesson for 3.2. We taught how to define variables and apply them in various situations. Throughout this lesson on Python variables, I’ve focused on making the core concepts easy to understand and apply. This experience has helped me develop a structured approach to teaching, starting from identifying key concepts to designing interactive examples. Organizing my thoughts in this way has solidified my ability to handle future tasks by making abstract ideas more practical and accessible.

Memory: A Highlight from My Presentation
One moment that stands out in my presentation was when I introduced how to represent Integers and other variables. Since this is a fundemental concept of python, it was nice to be able to set the foundation for everone's learning. 

Relevancy: A Learning from Another Lesson
A lesson I liked was 3.7 where they went in depth with conditional statements. It was nice to see how these variables interact with control flow statements like "if" and "else." This lesson connected variables together which provided a deeper level of understanding. Additionally, most of the teams had some segments that represented some code in javascript. It was nice to apply my understanding of python to javascript, and to see how they translate. Additionally, I liked learning about Iterations, which allowed me to automate repetitive actions without manually writing redundant code. Overall, the lessons were very benificial and deepened my understanding of python. 

Beyond Perfunctory: Personal Growth in This Sprint
 I tried new methods to approach the homework. I also only used to answer to check my work to make sure my work stayed original because I wanted to be genuine with my work. Overall this was a benifitial experience in solidifying my own understanding but in creating an engaging learning experience for my classmates.
