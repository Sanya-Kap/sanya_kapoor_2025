Sequential Computing:

---

In sequential Computing, tasks are done one after another. It is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time.


The computer works tasks A, B, C, â€¦ one at a time.

Why would it do that?

Limited hardware: It only has one CPU (older hardware).
Tasks are dependent: Task B depends on Task A, Task C depends on Task B, so the needed order is A, B, and finally C.

Execution Time: Sequential Operations add up all the individual task execution times.
Task A takes 50 ms
Task B takes 40 ms
Task C takes 35 ms
Total processing time is 50ms + 40ms + 35ms = 125ms

Think of Sequential Computing as items one at a time on a conveyor belt.

Parallel Computing

Why Parallel:

Hardware Driven: New hardware has several processors in one system, called cores. 1 CPU can have 64+ cores. Graphics cards for gaming can have thousands of cores.

Faster Operations: Supercomputers link hundreds of CPUs together to work the same problem.

Data Driven: A lot of data can be processed the same way (video gaming), called SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data).

Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing.

Key benefits of a fault-tolerant, redundant network system:


1. Minimizes Downtime: Ensures continuous operation even if a component fails.
2. Improved Reliability: Multiple backup systems keep the network running smoothly.
3. Data Integrity & Protection: Prevents data loss by using redundant storage and backup systems.
4. Load Balancing: Distributes network traffic efficiently, reducing congestion and improving performance.
5. Quick Recovery from Failures: Automatic failover mechanisms switch to backup systems instantly.
6. Enhanced Security: Redundancy helps protect against cyberattacks and hardware failures.
7. Scalability: Allows for future expansion without compromising performance.
8. Better User Experience: Ensures seamless access to applications and services without interruptions.

Practice Question!

The correct answer is C. The redundant system allows for multiple routes for devices which benifit efficiency and security incase one pathway fails.

Distributed Computing

How is it different from sequential and parallel execution?

- Uses more than one physical computer
- The computers, data, and tasks can be very different from each other
- Needs a network
- Is a mix of sequential and parallel execution of tasks
- Can take longer based on the network and waiting for responses from other computers

Answer: 25 seconds. Sequential computing would take 70 seconds. Parallel would take 45 seconds. The difference is 25 seconds.
