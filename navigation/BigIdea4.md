Definitions:
a) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver.
b) is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.
c) is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.
d) the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.
e) is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver.
f) is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.

More devices and more pathways makes the network stronger.

Computing

Sequential Computing

Sequential Computing. Tasks are done one after another. It is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time.

The computer works tasks A, B, C, â€¦ one at a time.

Why would it do that?

Limited hardware: It only has one CPU (older hardware).
Tasks are dependent: Task B depends on Task A, Task C depends on Task B, so the needed order is A, B, and finally C.

Execution Time: Sequential Operations add up all the individual task execution times.
Task A takes 50 ms
Task B takes 40 ms
Task C takes 35 ms
Total processing time is 50ms + 40ms + 35ms = 125ms

Think of Sequential Computing as items one at a time on a conveyor belt.

Parallel Computing

Why Parallel:

Hardware Driven: New hardware has several processors in one system, called cores. 1 CPU can have 64+ cores. Graphics cards for gaming can have thousands of cores.

Faster Operations: Supercomputers link hundreds of CPUs together to work the same problem.

Data Driven: A lot of data can be processed the same way (video gaming), called SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data).

Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing.

Distributed Computing

How is it different from sequential and parallel execution?

Uses more than one physical computer
The computers, data, and tasks can be very different from each other
Needs a network
Is a mix of sequential and parallel execution of tasks
Can take longer based on the network and waiting for responses from other computers
