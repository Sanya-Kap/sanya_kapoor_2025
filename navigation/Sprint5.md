## üñºÔ∏è Featured Projects
A collection of my work:

### Purpose of group project: 
*The website is a global platform where users can share and discover food reviews from around the world. Whether it's a hidden gem in Italy, street food in Thailand, or fine dining in France, the site allows travelers and food enthusiasts to post detailed reviews, including photos and ratings, about their culinary experiences.
The platform aims to connect people through the universal love of food, helping users explore authentic cuisines, make informed dining choices, and celebrate the cultural diversity of food in different countries. It fosters a global community of food lovers who inspire each other to try new dishes and discover unique flavors worldwide.*

### üõ†Ô∏è Checklist Item: *Asia Posts*  
*People who want to connect over Asian food and get reviews from honest customers can view this page. It saves the posts of all previous users and can be refered to later.*

Initially, I only understood APIs as a way for systems to communicate, but I hadn't implemented one myself. Now, I've developed a feature where users can create a review on the frontend, which sends data to the backend with the API, and stores it in a database. One challenge was handling the failed to fetch errors, but I learned how to fix it by configuring the backend properly and making sure the API paths are correct.

## üìù Reflections

Africa is a culturally diverse area that should be represented across the food review platform. Food connects communities and should be able to bring people together. I was motivated to make the posts save on the website so the posts could be refered back to and expanded upon, creating a platform for a community to form.
