## üñºÔ∏è Featured Projects
A collection of my work:

### Purpose of group project: 
*The website is a global platform where users can share and discover food reviews from around the world. Whether it's a hidden gem in Italy, street food in Thailand, or fine dining in France, the site allows travelers and food enthusiasts to post detailed reviews, including photos and ratings, about their culinary experiences.
The platform aims to connect people through the universal love of food, helping users explore authentic cuisines, make informed dining choices, and celebrate the cultural diversity of food in different countries. It fosters a global community of food lovers who inspire each other to try new dishes and discover unique flavors worldwide.*

## üìù Reflections

Africa is a culturally diverse area that should be represented across the food review platform. Food connects communities and should be able to bring people together. I was motivated to make the posts save on the website so the posts could be refered back to and expanded upon, creating a platform for a community to form.
