I learned that Flask-RESTful is API structured using a Blueprint, allowing modular organization and enabling multiple endpoints under the /api prefix. The southafricaAPI class defines a static method, get_food(name), which retrieves restaurant data from a dictionary-based data structure. Each restaurant is mapped to a RESTful resource, inheriting from Resource, and implements a get() method to return JSON-encoded responses. The API follows a declarative routing pattern, using api.add_resource() to associate endpoints like /food/born with their corresponding data. Additionally, a bulk endpoint consolidates all restaurant information into a single JSON response, improving data retrieval efficiency. This modular design adheres to abstraction and encapsulation principles, promoting scalability and maintainability.

### 🥉 **Achievement 3:** San Diego Frontend

This table is unique to san diego because it directs the posts to this table, instead of floating around beneath the posting feature.

I designed a detailed and visually appealing poster for Big Idea 4. The poster highlighted key definitions and real-world applications that aligns with what we built in class. This helped my understanding as putting the diagram together helped me piece together the different parts of the internet protocal. I learned how data is transfered through smaller packets and how computers communicate along the network. Having a visual summary helped my classmates engage with the material beyond classroom work and lectures.Some students learn better visually, and my poster provided an alternative method to absorb the information. 


## ✨ **Project Feature blog write up** ✨
This trimester has taught me a lot about Big Idea 4 through my poster and hands on experience with deployment. I did not have a strong grasp on the main ideas because of the different teaching style I had in trimester one. So jumping into creating features and using APIs acceslerated my knowledge and ability to code by a lot. I did stuggle at first, but I learned so much being exposed to deployment, APIs, and frontend vs backend.

## 🚀 **Goals for furture** 🚀
There is still a lot for me to improve on. I do not believe I earned a 10/10 because I am still solidifying my knowledge on deplyment. However, I do believe I earned a 9/10 because of how much I learned and perfomred in this trimester starting from almost nothing. I am proud of working through errors and developing my personal features as well as contributing to my teams organization. 
In the future, I want to go into biomedical engineering so this class helped me bridge my introduction to engineering.
